<h1>Web Evaluation I</h1>

<h4>Background information</h4>

<p>The <a href="/gccourse/">Global Change course</a> at Iowa State University, 
Ames Iowa USA, is a senior-level undergraduate course in Environmental
Science that seeks to provide students, particularly those
from environmental science, agriculture, and engineering,
with a global perspective on environmental problems.  The
course emphasizes the science elements of global
environmental change but also engages students in discussion
on the societal, ethical, and political implications of these changes.</p>

<p>The GC class of about 50 on-campus 
students who, by university tradition, meet 3 times per week (1100 to 1150 
on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) for 15 weeks beginning in mid January.  
One learning unit topic is covered during each class meeting.  On the 
basis of student recommendations after the 1999 course, class meetings 
have been reduced from 3 per week to 1 per week (only Wednesday from 1100 
to 1150) after the initial 2 weeks of the semester.  Three unit topics, 
rather than one, were discussed when class meetings were reduced to one 
per week.

<p>The web-based activities designed for students in the ICT and Learning 
course will focus on the on-campus students.

<h4>Use of quizzes to facilitate learning</h4>

<p>Students read the learning unit and take a quiz consisting of 3 
multiple choice questions before coming to the class meeting and before 
engaging in the online dialog.  The quiz questions are designed to require 
the students to do more than simply search for a fact.  Ideally, the 
question will require the student to make an interpretation of material 
presented, perform a calculation that reveals a new concept beyond the 
information provided, compare information in the present unit with 
material from past units, etc.  In short, the questions require the 
student to engage critical thinking skills in order to arrive at the 
correct answer.  Of course, it is not always easy to design good questions 
that engage all students in such critical thinking processes.

<h4>Collaborative learning activities</h4>

<p>In the 2001 offering of the course, students were divided into groups 
(arbitrarily by the instructor)  of 4 to 5 students each.  Each group was 
assigned an online group portfolio in which they could engage in private 
discussion.  For each learning unit, one group was assigned (by the 
instructor) to summarize, from the students’ perspective, the important 
points of the topic as gleaned from online reading material, online 
discussion among all members of the class, and discussion on this topic in 
the face-to-face class meetings.  Each group was expected to meet (either 
face-to-face or online) and construct a summary document that would 
subsequently be posted on the web for that particular unit.  They could 
divide the responsibility for completing this task in any way they chose.

<p>This activity was judged by the students to be a disaster!  Most groups 
had one or more students who failed to participate, leaving one or two 
students to do all the work.  Those groups that had full participation 
produced documents that more-or-less copied large segments verbatim from 
the online reading or dialog with almost no evidence of the use of 
critical thinking skills.  Evidently, this activity was poorly designed 
and led to little or no collaboration and little or no learning.  What 
went wrong?!

<h4>Tasks for the Danish students</h4>

<p>It would be very nice, if we all during our collaboration could
become a bit acquainted with each other (and put some faces on each
other) on both side of the Atlantic. Therefore, Elsebeth and I will 
ask you, as an initial action when you "inhabit" your portfolio, to 
insert a photo and some biographical information on yourself in the
portfolio feature, which is designed for this purpose. You will find 
a hot link with your name in the upper left corner of your portfolio
http://www.meteor.iastate.edu/jportfolio/aalborg/index.jsp. Press the
link, and you will have access to insert your biographical
information and photo - as well as continously ajust it.

<p>You are asked to play the role of an on-campus Global Change student
and evaluate the usefulness of some of the web-based features of this
course. More specifically, you are asked to complete the following
tasks:

<h4>Tasks - Web Evaluation I, part 1:</h4>

<ol>
<li>Access the Global Change Homepage and the list of learning
units to see how the course is divided into three 5-week Blocks.</li>

<li>Access the Overview Learning Unit (1-1) to observe the
general structure for each learning unit.</li>

<li>Access the unit on Evolution of the Atmosphere (Unit 1-2) and
read the assigned material given under Summary Information. Take the
quiz associated with this learning unit.</li>

<li>Access the discussion pages in your portfolio and post (as a  
reply to the thread "Web Evaluation I - Part 1" your views and
opinions of the usefulness of on-line quizzes for enhancing learning.</li>

<li>Read the comments posted by other Danish students and post
one comment or more on opinions and suggestions of another student.</li>
</ol>

<h4>Tasks - Web Evaluation I, part 2:</h4>

<ol>
<li>Access your group portfolio and carry out the following task:</li>

<li>Consider the failed group activity of the Global Change course
(i.e. "the collaborative learning activity"), described in Web
Evaluation I.</li>

<li>Consider the design og the activity and discuss between you (here
in this group forum) the potential causes in terms of its pedagogical
and technological design aspects</li>

<li>Come up with the specifications (about 350 words) for a group
activity FOR YOUR OWN m1k4:CaseUSA course which you anticipate will  
enhance collaboration and knowledge building, and add quality to your
own learning process</li>

<li>Present your design as a plenum posting (denoting, in the title,
the name of your group) in the Web Evaluation I, part 2 thread in our
shared dialogue space in this portfolio.</li>
</ol>
