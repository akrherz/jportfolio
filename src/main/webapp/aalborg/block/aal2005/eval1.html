1) Background information on Global Change (GC) course, 2)
Information on CIT eDoc, an electronic portfolio system for

course</B></FONT></H2>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">The
Global Change course at Iowa State University, Ames Iowa USA, is a
senior-level undergraduate course in Environmental Science that seeks
to provide students, particularly those from environmental science,
agriculture, and engineering, with a global perspective on
environmental problems.&nbsp; The course emphasizes the science
elements of global environmental change but also engages students in
discussion on the societal, ethical, and political implications of
these changes.</FONT></P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">The
GC class of about 50 on-campus students who, by university tradition,
meet 3 times per week (1100 to 1150 on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday)
for 15 weeks beginning in mid January. For a variety of reasons
(schedule conflicts, study abroad, etc.), a small number of these
students take the course completely without face-to-face contact. 
One learning unit topic is covered during each class meeting. On the
basis of student recommendations after the 1999 course, class
meetings have been reduced from 3 per week to approximately 1 per
week after the initial 2 weeks of the semester. Class meetings
emphasize synthesizing discussion and current developments.</FONT></P>

</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">A
pedagogical feature widely used in the US tradition, although
generally considered to have little if any learning value by Danish
tradition, is the quiz. Students in GC are asked to read the learning
unit and take a quiz consisting of 3 multiple choice questions before
coming to the class meeting and before engaging in the online dialog.
The quiz questions are designed to require the students to do more
than simply search for a fact. Ideally, the question will require the
student to make an interpretation of material presented, perform a
calculation that reveals a new concept beyond the information
provided, compare information in the present unit with material from
past units, etc. In short, the questions require the student to
engage in critical thinking skills in order to arrive at the correct
answer. Of course, it is not always easy to design good questions
that engage all students in such critical thinking processes.  The
quiz also provides valuable incentive for students to read material
before coming to class or engaging in web-based dialog.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">In
the 2001 offering of the course, students were divided into groups
(arbitrarily by the instructor) of 4 to 5 students each. Each group
was assigned an online group portfolio in which they could engage in
private discussion. For each learning unit, one group was assigned
(by the instructor) to summarize, from the students’ perspective,
the important points of the topic as gleaned from online reading
material, online discussion among all members of the class, and
discussion on this topic in the face-to-face class meetings. Each
group was expected to meet (either face-to-face or online) and
construct a summary document that would subsequently be posted on the
web for that particular unit. They could divide the responsibility
for completing this task in any way they chose. </FONT>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, serif">This
activity was judged by the students to be a disaster! Most groups had
one or more students who failed to participate, leaving one or two
students to do all the work. Those groups that had full participation
produced documents that more-or-less copied large segments verbatim
from the online reading or dialog with almost no evidence of the use
of critical thinking skills. Evidently, this activity was poorly
designed and led to little or no collaboration and little or no
learning. What went wrong?!</FONT></P>
