  <h4><a name="#1">1</a>. What is Portfolio?</h4>
  
  <blockquote>Good question!  Portfolio is an on-line workspace
  for interactive collaboration among students, faculty, scientists
  and others.  The free-form nature of the system allows Portfolio to
  be adapted to a particular need for different groups.<br>
  In the GCP setting, Portfolio is used to proctor quizes, manage on-line
  discussion, manage user information and other things.  So the collection 
  of Portfolio applications can be thought of as comprising one Portfolio.

  <h4><a name="#2">2</a>. How do I create an account with Portfolio?</h4>
  
  <blockquote>The Portfolio system must be able to identify who you are, so
  you need to create an account.  You can create an account by accessing the
  following URL with most web browser, 
  <a href="http://www.meteor.iastate.edu/jportfolio">http://www.meteor.iastate.edu/jportfolio</a>.
  This is the main page for the Portfolio system.  If you follow the link that says
  "Create Account", you will be presented with a page in which you can enter information.
  <br>Once you have successfully created an account, you are able to log in and utlize
  the system.  Remember that this process only created you an account with Portfolio
  Manager, you will still need to register for th GCP Portfolio.
