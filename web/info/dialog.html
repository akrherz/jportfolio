<h4>Purpose of Dialog</h4>

<P>The purpose of class discussion, whether in a face-to-face class or as online dialog, is to stimulate creative thinking and gain practice at deploying higher-level thinking skills.  Not all dialog serves this purpose. We all have experienced idle chatter as part of dialog, both face-to-face and online.  While some such chatter has a valuable social function, excessive amounts, particularly if a large class is compelled to listen to it, are a waste of time and may be counterproductive due to emergence of cynicism or resentment of having to be a part of such dialog.  

<P>We refer to class dialog that includes examples of higher-level thinking skills as <B>knowledge-building dialog</B>, since it can become as essential to the learning objectives of the course as the factual information and active tasks required of the student (perhaps even moreso).

<P>Gerry Stahl provides an observation on knowledge construction:

<i>Students more readily engage in discussion, responding spontaneously to existing notes without taking time to appropriate the ideas in new syntheses.  True construction of knowledge involves distinct tasks including brainstorming, articulating, reacting, organizing, analyzing and generalizing.</i>  (Stahl, 1999)

<h4>Metaphor of  a Committee Meeting</h4>

<P>Online discussion can be thought of as a committee meeting or a task meeting in a work environment.  This is the kind of experience that most students will face in employment situations.  People are usually asked to come to a meeting because they bring some information, skill, or insight that the committee needs to complete its task.  So participation by everyone is desirable.  The committee functions well when each member responds, when appropriate, to another committee member.  Good comments usually elicit responses from others and irrelevant comments usually lead to a change of topic.  The committee also functions well when each participant offers relevant comments that contribute to the task.

<P>Additionally, committee participants should come to the meeting prepared, meaning they should not ask questions for which information was provided in advance unless it was unclear (discussion should not ask for a repeat of class material, but should include requests for clarification or implications).  

<h4>Characteristics of Discussion that Build Knowledge</h4>

<P>Stahl (1999) offers some characteristics of knowledge-building discussion:

<ul>
<li><B>Brainstorming</B></li><BR>
Brainstorming is the introducing of new ideas that relate to the topic or task of the committee and offer a perspective not previously considered.  It the idea is pretty 'far out', it needs to be explained in sufficient detail to justify its plausibility.

<li><B>Articulating</B></li><BR>
Articulating means explaining complex or difficult concepts.  This could apply to (a) course material that may be difficult to understand, (b) new material brought into the course discussion from other sources and explained, or (c) comments of other students that seem incomplete and need further explanation.

<li><B>Reacting</B></li><BR>
Reaction should provide an alternative or amplified perspective on a concept previously introduced into the discussion.  Simply stating that you agree with a particular point of view or result does not contribute to the knowledge-building process;  rather, new points or perspectives must be added. 

<li><B>Organization</B></li><BR>
Occasionally, an organization of existing thoughts or perspectives helps to clarify the flow of discussion (e.g., identifying that there are really only two lines of thinking in the dialog despite numerous comments in seemingly different directions).  In addition to its application to discussion, organization may apply to course materials (e.g., a US map showing regions on high windpower potential together with a US map showing regions of high electric power rates might be used to create a list of states where windpower might be economically feasible). 

<li><B>Analysis</B></li><BR>
Analysis is a powerful knowledge-building characteristic that includes comparing or contrasting previously articulated views.  It also could include new calculations from existing data that shed new light on the issue under consideration (e.g., calculating how much the global sea level would rise if the Greenland ice sheet were to melt).

<li><B>Generalization</B></li><BR>
Generalization is another powerful characteristic that takes comments or data already presented and extracts new information or knowledge that applies to a broader set of conditions.  For instance, since global warming extends the growing season for agricultural crops in cold climates, it might be tempting to generalize that all countries north of 50 degrees N latitude will have increased crop production under global warming.  Even though such generalizations must be carefully tested for their truth, they do offer a positive step in the knowledge-building process. Generalizations are very thought provoking because they immediately challenge the reader to search for counter-examples. 
</ul>

<P>The following characteristics are helpful and move the discussion forward:
<BR>
<BR>+  Questions requesting clarification of ambiguous points
<BR>+  New and relevant authoritative information that goes beyond what was provided
<BR>+  Opinions, provided they are substantiated with logical arguments from accepted facts
<BR>+  Synthesis of given information that suggests a new conclusion
<BR>+  Hypotheses whose testing would lead to new information
<BR>+  Calculations that lead to new conclusions or reveal new insights (one student calculated how much sea level will rise due to a very large chunk of ice breaking off Antarctica)

<h4>Characteristics of Discussion that do not Build Knowledge</h4>

<P>The following characteristics are not helpful to the task, contribute to a general loss of credibility to the author, and reduce the contribution of the author to the task:

<BR>-  Sweeping generalizations ("Anyone who drives an SUV doesn't care about preserving our environment")
<BR>-  Impractical solutions ("We should stop global warming now by not burning fossil fuels")
<BR>-  Unsubstantiated claims ("Global warming will turn the US Midwest into a desert")
Questions raised that are so broad or simplistic that they impede progress of the discussion ("Why don't we pass a law that a family can have only one car?")
Degrading or impolite comments
<BR>Such comments usually do not promote knowledge building although occasionally they stimulate someone else to post a response that may eventually stimulate some deeper thinking.

<h4>Selecting a classification of a dialog comment</h4>

<P>The threaded dialog you are using has the feature that you may choose the category of comment you are about to post.  This forces you to reflect over the purpose you have in mind for the statements you are about to make.  In some classes using this threaded dialog feature, students are asked to demonstrate to the instructor the higher-level thinking skill being employed in the comment and their success at creating comments having these characteristics is part of the grading scheme for the course.
