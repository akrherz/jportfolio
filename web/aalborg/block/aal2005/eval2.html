engagement of the student enhances learning. In the Global Change
course, computer-based simulations allow students to perform
“experiments” to help deepen their understanding of physical
relationships and mathematical concepts.  Two such experiments are
the “Pinball Simulation” and the “Java Climate Model”.  The
first was created by a student in the class, and the second was
created by Dr. Ben Matthews of the Georges Lemaitre Institute of
Astronomy and Geophysics at Universite catholique de Louvain in
Belgium. You are &quot;visitors&quot; to the Global Change course,
and may not have a full understanding of the background for these
experiments. However, you may be able to imagine how such experiments
might be used in your teaching and, on that basis, evaluate the use
of this technique for facilitating the learning process.</FONT></P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">James E. Hansen,
Director of the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies, has
estimated that the maximum amount of additional global warming the
Earth system can take without major effects such as eventually (not
this century) melting the Greenland icepack, is about 1 degree C.  He
notes that during the last accelerated warming at the end of the last
ice age, sea level rose by about 1 m every 20 years for several
centuries.  A 1 degree C rise in temperature translates into an
additional radiative forcing of about 1 Watt/m2.  The Java
interactive climate modeling system 
(http://www.chooseclimate.org/jcm/ ) allows exploration of the
relationships of emissions of carbon dioxide to global temperature
increases, regional patterns of warming, increased radiative forcing,
sea level rise, and many more factors.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is a much more
sophisticated and professional simulation than pinball and allows for
investigation of interesting questions like:</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&quot;Choose the amount
of sea level rise due to global warming that you think is acceptable
for Denmark (or Amsterdam or Bangladesh or wherever you like) over
the next 100 years.  Then use the interactive Java model to determine
what maximum level of atmospheric carbon dioxide is allowable for
various global climate models and the allowable CO2 emissions.  From
the Distribution map suggest how the various regions of the world
will need to reduce their emissions to achieve this goal.&quot;</P>

<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">or</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in"><BR>
</P>
<P CLASS="western" STYLE="margin-bottom: 0in">&quot;To avoid setting
the Greenland ice sheet on an irreversible path of complete melting
(with attendant rise in global sea level of 7 meters) humans need to
avoid introducing an additional 1 Watt/m2 of anthropogenic forcing. 
Determine the maximum atmospheric CO2 concentration to achieve this
result and suggest what levels of emissions reductions are required
from the US, Western Europe, Japan, etc. to achieve this goal&quot;</P>
