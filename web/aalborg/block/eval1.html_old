<B><P>Background information </P>
</B>
<P>The Global Change course at Iowa State University, Ames Iowa USA, is a senior-level undergraduate course in Environmental Science that seeks to provide students, particularly those from environmental science, agriculture, and engineering, with a global perspective on environmental problems.  The course emphasizes the science elements of global environmental change but also engages students in discussion on the societal, ethical, and political implications of these changes. </P>

<P>Students taking the course are on the campus at Iowa State University  (they are not taking the course completely over the web), but much of their interaction with the course is over the web.  However, the class meets 3 times per week (1100 to 1150 Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) and one learning unit topic is covered during each class meeting.  </P>

<B><P>Use of quizzes to facilitate learning and inform the instructor of difficulties</P>
</B>
<P>Students read the learning unit and take the quiz before coming to the class meeting.  The summary of student performance on the quiz is reported electronically to the learning unit for that day and is used by the instructor during the class meeting as a guide to specific items from the learning unit that present students with the most difficulty.</P>

<B><P>Cooperative learning</P>
</B>
<P>Four or five students are assigned to work together to summarize the material for that unit and post their summary on the web.  They are to summarize key points from the online reading and key points raised in the online dialog.</P>
